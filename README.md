# Description of cluster profiles for the clusters defined. Recommendation of different promotional strategies for different clusters in context to the business problem in-hand.

As per our initial understanding Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. As we have seen from all of above Questions 3 clusters are optimum because we can easily group all of them.

As we can see that Group 2 is having high spending, advance payment and high probability of full payment & their Credit limit is also high in this case , Group 2 peoples are also spent maximum amount in their single shopping . Cluster Group no.1 is having lowest spending, advance payment and lowest probability of full payment & their Credit limit is also lowest among all.
Considering at above two points we can divide it into 3 Groups. 

Group 2:- Highest spending Group 

Group 0 :- Medium Spending Group 

Group 1 :- Lowest Spending Group
